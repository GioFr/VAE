# Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
In this notebook I explore variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Mnist's fashion dataset. Variational autoencoders are meant to compress the input information into a constrained multivariate latent distribution (encoding) to reconstruct it as accurately as possible (decoding).

To train the model mnist fashion datset is used
